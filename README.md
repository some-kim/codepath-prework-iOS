1. Slack
  - UI/UX makes sense and doesn't take long to figure out there are options to join across emails if you have different responsibilities 
  - Abilty to search for people, messages, and dates within a Slack organization
  - Can organize different topics in different Slack channels so messages and media don't get cluttered
    
2. Polytopia
  - The interface to create or join a game is straight-forward and self explanatory
  - There's like a flow/sequence on how to customize different parts of you game and diferent categories
  - I could see ways to over complicate this process or make it less streamlined, I like the way they approached their layout

3. Evernote
- Easy to create and organize quick notes
- Sadly started limiting some features in the free version but there's still a lot I like
- Can access these notes by signing in across different devices, syncs changes

4. Noteful
- Great for creating and organizing notes for class 
- Prefer this more than GoodNotes because of how files are backed up and saved 
- GoodNotes is iCLoud based and if you don't have enough storage you lose notes. Noteful allows you to back up to your Google Drive and other storage accounts
- Easy to create, edit, and export notes
- Many edit and writing features
  
5. Libby
- Seamlessly connects to your different library cards
- If a book isn't avaible at one libaary it checks it's avaiablity at another library you have a card for
- You can know how many people are ahead of you for the hold and it estimates how many weeks it will take until you can borrow the book or audio


One of the apps I want to buiild is a game I showed my mom when I was younger on my cousin's Blackberry. It was called Bubble Burst, when I searched Google Play and Apple App Store there are games similar to it but none that have those specific features. I want to remake it for my family since it holds a memory for us.
