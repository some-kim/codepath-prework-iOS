1. Slack
  - UI/UX makes sense and is self explanitory there are options to join across emails if you have different respanbilties
  - Abilty to search for people, messages, and dates within a Slack organization
  - Can organize different topics in different Slack channels so things don't get cluttered


2. Polytopia
  - The interface to create or join a game is straight forward and self explaintory
  - There's like a flow/sequence on how to custimize different parts of you game and diferent catergoies
  - I could see ways to over comiliacne this prcess or make it sless streamlined, I like the way they apporached their layout

3. Evernote
- Easy to create and organize quick notes
- Sadly started limiting some features in the free version but there's still a lot I like
- Can log into notes by signing across different devices, syncs changes

4. Noteful
- Great for creating and organizing notes for class 
- Prefer this more than GoodNotes because of how files are backed up and saved 
- GoodNotes is iCLoud based and if ou don't have enough storgae you loose notes. Noteful allows you to back up to your Google Drive and other storage accountds
- Easy to create edit and export notes
- Alot of edit and writing features
  
5. Libby
- Seemlessly connects to your different library cards
- If a book isn't avaible at one libaary it checks it's avaiablity at other libabrays you have a card for
- You can know how many people are a head of you for the hold and it estimates how many weeks it will take until you can borror the book or audio


One of the apps I want to buiild is a game I showed my mom, I was younger on my cousin's Blackberry. It was called Bubble Burst, when I searched Google Play and Apple Store there are games similar to it but none that have those specific features. I want to remake it for my family since it holds a memory for us.
